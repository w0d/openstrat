 *  they are finished games, with established rules and iconography. As opposed to applications like GOne, GTwo etc, which are super simple games
 *  merely created for the teaching of the use use of the ostrat libraries. And also as opposed to the games in the Dev module which are intended to
 *  be developed into interesting games which may at some point have their own individual repositories. */
